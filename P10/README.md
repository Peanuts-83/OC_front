You have been employed for 5 years at Dev4U, a digital services company.

Learn@Home is an association that connects children with learning difficulties with volunteer tutors. Basically, their goal is to allow any student, anywhere, to have access to remote tutoring. They confirmed to us that they wanted to work with us on their website project.

Our first step is to clearly define the customer's needs, before starting pure software development. We have scheduled a new meeting in a few weeks, the objective is that you present the following elements to them:

* **Use case diagrams** for each of the major features of each page (login, chat, calendar, task manager, dashboard), no need to use UML.
* **User stories** with acceptance criteria(s) for each feature, shared in a standard format (PDF, DOCX, XLSX).
* **Site mockups** with a simple design and at least one mockup per page (you can use Figma or Sketch).
* A **Kanban** dividing the project, in a macro way (technical details excluded) into blocks of functionalities and sub-functionalities for development. I started the breakdown in this kanban on Notion, it's up to you to finish completing the "ANALYZE" column on the same model. You can work on Notion, Trello or GitHub.
